          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is
            designed for creating network-centric applications. It is
            complementary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy
            to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and
            cross-platform.

            <h2>Why to learn JavaScript</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world
                and that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learn
                Javascript, it helps you develop great front-end as well as
                back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks
                like jQuery, NodeJS etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast
                websites. You can develop your website with a console like look
                and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of
                frameworks and Libraries already developed which can be used
                directly in your software development to reduce your time to
                market.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="applications">
            <h2>Applications of JavaScript Programming</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Client side validation - </span>
                This is really important to verify any user input before
                submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important
                role in validating those inputs at the front-end itself.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Manipulating HTML Pages - </span>
                Javascript helps in manipulating HTML pages on the fly. This
                helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using
                javascript and modifying your HTML to change its look and feel
                based on different devices and requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">User Notifications - </span>
                You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages
                to give different types of notifications to your website
                visitors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Back-end Data Loading - </span>
                Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end
                data while you are doing some other processing. This really
                gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Presentations - </span>
                JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations
                which gives the website look and feel. JavaScript provides
                RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build web-based slide
                presentations.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="syntax">
            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are
            placed within the
            <span class="monospace"> &lt;script&gt;... &lt;/script&gt; </span>
            HTML tags in a web page.
            <div class="examples">
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <div class="code">
                &lt;html&gt;<br />
                &lt;body&gt;<br />
                &lt;script language = "javascript" type =
                "text/javascript"&gt;<br />
                &nbsp; document.write("Hello World!")<br />
                &lt;/script&gt;<br />
                &lt;/body&gt;<br />
                &lt;/html&gt;<br />
              </div>
            </div>
            This prints out <span class="monospace">Hello World</span> in the
            web page

            <h3>Whitespace and Line Breaks</h3>
            <p>
              JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in
              JavaScript programs. You can use spaces, tabs, and newlines freely
              in your program and you are free to format and indent your
              programs in a neat and consistent way that makes the code easy to
              read and understand.
            </p>
            <h3>Semicolons are Optional</h3>
            <p>
              Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a
              semicolon character, just as they are in C, C++, and Java.
              JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of
              your statements are placed on a separate line.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="statements_comments">
            <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
            <p>
              Javascript statements are composed of values, operators,
              expressions, keywords and comments.
            </p>
            This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Web Development."
            inside an HTML element with
            <span class="monospace">id="demo"</span>:
            <div class="examples">
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <br />
              <span class="code">
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Web
                Development.";</span
              >
            </div>
            <p>
              The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they
              are written.
            </p>
            <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
            <p>
              JavaScript supports both C-style and C++-style comments, Thus any
              text between a <span class="monospace">//</span> and the end of a
              line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript and any
              text between the characters
              <span class="monospace">/* */</span> is also treated as a comment.
              This may span multiple lines.
            </p>
            <div class="examples">
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                The following example shows how to use comments in JavaScript.
              </p>
              <div class="code">
                &lt; script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript"&gt;
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;// This is a single line comment in JavaScript
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;/*<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a multi-line comment in JavaScript<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp; It is very similar to comments in C Programming<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;*/<br />
                &lt;/script&gt;
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div id="variables_operators">
            <h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
            <p>
              Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables.
              Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place
              data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by
              naming the container.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must
              declare it.
            </p>
            <div class="examples">
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <p>Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows:</p>
              <div class="code">
                var money;<br />
                var name;
              </div>
              <p>
                You can also declare multiple variables with the same var
                keyword as follows
              </p>
              <div class="code">var money, name;</div>
            </div>
            <h3>Variable Initialization</h3>
            <p>
              Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization.
              You can do variable initialization at the time of variable
              creation or at a later point in time when you need that variable.
            </p>
            <div class="examples">
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <p>
                For instance, you might create a variable named money and assign
                the value 2000.50 to it later:
              </p>
              <div class="code">
                var money;<br />
                money = 2000.50;
              </div>
              <p>
                For another variable, you can assign a value at the time of
                initialization as follows:
              </p>
              <div class="code">var name = "IWT";</div>
            </div>
            <p>
              JavaScript is an untyped language. This means that a JavaScript
              variable can hold a value of any data type. Unlike many other
              languages, you don't have to tell JavaScript during variable
              declaration what type of value the variable will hold. The value
              type of a variable can change during the execution of a program
              and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.
            </p>
            <h3>JavaScript Variable Scope</h3>
            <p>
              The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it
              is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Global Variables</b> − A global variable has global scope
                which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Global Variables</b> − A local variable will be visible only
                within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are
                always local to that function.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence
              over a global variable with the same name. If you declare a local
              variable or function parameter with the same name as a global
              variable, you effectively hide the global variable.
            </p>
            <h3>JavaScript Variable Names</h3>
            <p>
              While naming your variables in JavaScript, keep the following
              rules in mind:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keywords as a
                variable name. These keywords are mentioned in the next section.
                For example, break or boolean variable names are not valid.
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9).
                They must begin with a letter or an underscore character. For
                example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a
                valid one.
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. For example, Name
                and name are two different variables.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>JavaScript Operators</h2>
            <p>
              In the expression 4 + 5 = 9, 4, 5 and 9 are called the opearnds
              while + and = are called the operators.
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript supports the following types of operators:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
              <li>Comparison Operators</li>
              <li>Logical (or Relational) Operators</li>
              <li>Assignment Operators</li>
              <li>Conditional (or ternary) Operators</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
            JavaScript supports<br />+ (Addition)<br />- (Subtraction)<br />*
            (Multiplication)<br />/ (Division)<br />% (Modulus)<br />++
            (Increment)<br />-- (Decrement)
            <div class="examples">
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <p>
                The following code shows how to use arithmetic operators in
                JavaScript:
              </p>
              <div class="code">
                var a = 33; <br />
                var b = 10;<br />
                var c = "Test";<br />
                var linebreak = "&lt;br /&gt;";<br /><br />

                document.write("a + b = ");<br />
                result = a + b;<br />
                document.write(result);<br />
                document.write(linebreak);<br />
                <br />
                document.write("a - b = ");<br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>& (Bitwise AND) - </b>
                It performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of its integer
                arguments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>| (BitWise OR) - </b>
                It performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its integer
                arguments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>^ (Bitwise XOR) - </b>
                It performs a Boolean exclusive OR operation on each bit of its
                integer arguments. Exclusive OR means that either operand one is
                true or operand two is true, but not both.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>~ (Bitwise Not) - </b>
                It is a unary operator and operates by reversing all the bits in
                the operand.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b><< (Left Shift) - </b>
                It moves all the bits in its first operand to the left by the
                number of places specified in the second operand. New bits are
                filled with zeros. Shifting a value left by one position is
                equivalent to multiplying it by 2, shifting two positions is
                equivalent to multiplying by 4, and so on.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>>> (Right Shift) - </b>
                Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operand’s value is moved

              HTML form validation can be done by JavaScript.

            </p>
            <p>
              If a form field (fname) is empty, this function alerts a message, and returns false, to prevent the form from being submitted:

            </p>
            <div class="examples">
              <h3>JavaScript Example:</h3>
              <div class="code">
                function validateForm() {<br>
                  &nbsp;var x = document.forms["myForm"]["fname"].value;<br>
                  &nbsp; if (x == "") {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; alert("Name must be filled out");<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; return false;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                    &nbsp;}      <br>
              </div>
              <p>The function can be called when the form is submitted:</p>
              <h3>HTML Form Example:</h3>
              <div class="code">
                &lt;form name="myForm" action="/action_page.php" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post"&gt;<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp; Name: &lt;input type="text" name="fname"&gt;<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;/form&gt;<br>

            <h2>JavaScript - Functions</h2>
            <p>A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions</p>
            <p>Like any other advanced programming language, JavaScript also supports all the features necessary to write modular code using functions. You must have seen functions like alert() and write() in the earlier chapters. We were using these functions again and again, but they had been written in core JavaScript only once</p>
            <p>JavaScript allows us to write our own functions as well. This section explains how to write your own functions in JavaScript</p>
             <div>
               <h3>Function Definition</h3>
               <p>Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.</p>
             </div>
             <div>
               <h4>Syntax</h4>
               <p>The basic syntax is shown here.</p>
                 <div>
                  <span class="monospace">&lt;script type = "text/javascript"></span><br>
                   <span class="monospace">&lt;!--</span><br>
                   <span class="monospace">&nbsp;&nbsp;function functionname(parameter-list)</span> {<br>
                   <span class="monospace">&nbsp;&nbsp; statements</span><br>
                   <span class="monospace">&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span><br>
                   <span class="monospace">&nbsp;&nbsp;//--></span><br>
                   <span class="monospace">&lt;/script></span>
                 </div>

             </div>
             <div class="examples">
               <h3>Example:</h3>
               <div class="code">
                 &lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
                 &lt;!--<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;function sayHello() {<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp; alert("Hello there");<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;//--><br>
                 &lt;/script>
               </div>
             </div>
             <div>
               <h4>Calling a Function</h4>
               <p>To invoke a function somewhere later in the script, you would simply need to write the name of that function as shown in the following code.</p>
             </div>
             <div class="code">
               &lt;html><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;function sayHello() {<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;document.write ("Hello there!");<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;}<br>
               &lt;/script><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head><br>
               &lt;body><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p>Click the following button to call the function&lt;/p><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;form><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type = "button" onclick = "sayHello()" value = "Say Hello"><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/form><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p>Use different text in write method and then try...&lt;/p><br>
               &lt;/body><br>
               &lt;/html>
             </div>
             <div>
              <h4>Function Parameters</h4>
              <p>Till now, we have seen functions without parameters. But there is a facility to pass different parameters while calling a function. These passed parameters can be captured inside the function and any manipulation can be done over those parameters. A function can take multiple parameters separated by comma</p>
              <div class="examples">
                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <div class="code">

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;function sayHello(name, age) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;document.write (name + " is " + age + " years old.");<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head><br>

   &lt;body><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p>Click the following button to call the function&lt;/p><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;form><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type = "button" onclick = "sayHello('Zara', 7)" value = "Say Hello"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/form><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p>Use different parameters inside the function and then try...&lt;/p><br>
   &lt;/body><br>

                </div>

              </div>

             </div>
             <div>
              <h4>The return Statement</h4>
              <p>A JavaScript function can have an optional return statement. This is required if you want to return a value from a function. This statement should be the last statement in a function.</p>
              <p>For example, you can pass two numbers in a function and then you can expect the function to return their multiplication in your calling program.</p>
              <div class="examples">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <div class="code">

          <div id="objects_Events">
            <h2>Objects and Events</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. A programming language can be called object-oriented if it provides four basic capabilities to developers −</p><br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Encapsulation −</b> the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.</li>
              <li><b>Aggregation −</b>Aggregation − the capability to store one object inside another object.</li>
              <li><b>Inheritance −</b> the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.</li>
              <li><b>Polymorphism −</b> the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Objects are composed of attributes. If an attribute contains a function, it is considered to be a method of the object, otherwise the attribute is considered a property.</p><br>
            <h3>Object Properties</h3>
            <p>Object properties can be any of the three primitive data types, or any of the abstract data types, such as another object. Object properties are usually variables that are used internally in the object's methods, but can also be globally visible variables that are used throughout the page.</p>
            <p>The syntax for adding a property to an object is −</p>
            <span class="monospace">objectName.objectProperty = propertyValue;</span><br>
            <h3>Object Methods</h3>
            <p>Methods are the functions that let the object do something or let something be done to it. There is a small difference between a function and a method – at a function is a standalone unit of statements and a method is attached to an object and can be referenced by the 'this' keyword.</p>
            <p>Methods are useful for everything from displaying the contents of the object to the screen to performing complex mathematical operations on a group of local properties and parameters.</p>
            <p>For example − Following is a simple example to show how to use the <span class="monospace">write()</span> method of document object to write any content on the document.</p>
            <span class="monospace">document.write("This is test");</span><br>
            <h3>User-Defined Objects</h3>
            <p>All user-defined objects and built-in objects are descendants of an object called Object.</p><br>
            <h4>The new Operator</h4>
            <p>The new operator is used to create an instance of an object. To create an object, the new operator is followed by the constructor method.</p>
            <p>In the following example, the constructor methods are Object(), Array(), and Date(). These constructors are built-in JavaScript functions.</p>
            <span class="monospace">var employee = new Object();</span><br>
            <span class="monospace">var books = new Array("C++", "Perl", "Java");</span><br>
            <span class="monospace">var day = new Date("August 15, 1947");</span><br>
            <h4>The Object() Constructor</h4>
            <p>A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object. JavaScript provides a special constructor function called Object() to build the object. The return value of the Object() constructor is assigned to a variable.</p>
            <p>The variable contains a reference to the new object. The properties assigned to the object are not variables and are not defined with the var keyword.</p>
            <div class="examples">
              <h3>Examples</h3>
              <div class="code">
                &lt;html><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title>User-defined objects</title> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;var book = new Object();  &nbsp;&nbsp; // Create the object <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;book.subject = "Perl";   &nbsp;&nbsp;  // Assign properties to the object <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;book.author  = "Mohtashim";<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script> <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head><br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;document.write("Book name is : " + book.subject + "&lt;br>"); <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;document.write("Book author is : " + book.author + "&lt;br>"); <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script>  <br>

      <h3>Defining Methods for an Object</h3>
      <p>The previous examples demonstrate how the constructor creates the object and assigns properties. But we need to complete the definition of an object by assigning methods to it.</p>
      <div class="examples">
        <h3>Ezample</h3>
        <div class="code">
          &lt;html><br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title>User-defined objects</title><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;// Define a function which will work as a method <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;function addPrice(amount) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;this.price = amount; <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>

         &nbsp;&nbsp;function book(title, author) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;this.title = title;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;this.author  = author;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;this.addPrice = addPrice; &nbsp;&nbsp; // Assign that method as property.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script> <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head><br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;var myBook = new book("Perl", "Mohtashim");<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;myBook.addPrice(100);<br>

         &nbsp;&nbsp;document.write("Book title is : " + myBook.title + "&lt;br>");<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;document.write("Book author is : " + myBook.author + "&lt;br>");<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;document.write("Book price is : " + myBook.price + "&lt;br>");<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script>  <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body><br>

<div>
  <h3>Events</h3>
  <div>
    <h4>what is an Event</h4>
    <p>JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.</p>
    <p>When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.</p>
    <p>Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript coded responses, which cause buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, data to be validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.</p>
    <p>Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 and every HTML element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>onclick Event Type</h4>
    <p>This is the most frequently used event type which occurs when a user clicks the left button of his mouse. You can put your validation, warning etc., against this event type.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="examples">
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <div class="code">
        &lt;html><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head>   <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!-- <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;function sayHello() { <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;alert("Hello World") <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;//--> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script> <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head><br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p>Click the following button and see result&lt;/p>  <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;form><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type = "button" onclick = "sayHello()" value = "Say Hello" /><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/form>   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body> <br>
&lt;/html><br>


      </div>


    </div>
</div>
<div>
  <h4>onsubmit Event Type</h4>
  <p>onsubmit is an event that occurs when you try to submit a form. You can put your form validation against this event type.</p>
  <div class="examples">
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <div class="code">
      &lt;html><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!--<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;function validation() {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;   all validation goes here <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; .........<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; return either true or false <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;//--><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script>   <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; /head><br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body>   <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;form method = "POST" action = "t.cgi" onsubmit = "return validate()"><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;.......<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type = "submit" value = "Submit" /><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/form><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body><br>
&lt;/html><br>


    </div>

  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <h4>Onmouseover and Onmouseout</h4>
  <p>These two event types will help you create nice effects with images or even with text as well. The onmouseover event triggers when you bring your mouse over any element and the onmouseout triggers when you move your mouse out from that element. Try the following example.</p>
  <div class="examples">
    <div class="code">
      &lt;html><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head>  <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script type = "text/javascript"><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!--<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;  function over() {<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;document.write ("Mouse Over");<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;}     <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function out() {<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;document.write ("Mouse Out");<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;}          <br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;//--><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script>  <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head><br>

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p>Bring your mouse inside the division to see the result:&lt;/p>    <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div onmouseover = "over()" onmouseout = "out()"><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h2> This is inside the division &lt;/h2><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div>    <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body><br>
  &lt;/html><br>

                  <div>
                    <p>While writing a program, there may be a situation when you need to adopt one out of a given set of paths. In such cases, you need to use conditional statements that allow your program to make correct decisions and perform right actions.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Here we will explain the if..else statement.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>JavaScript supports the following forms of if..else statement −</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>if statement</li>
                        <li>if...else statement</li>
                        <li>if...else if... statement.</li>

                  <p>The if...else if... statement is an advanced form of if…else that allows JavaScript to make a correct decision out of several conditions.</p><br>
                  <h5>Syntax</h5>

    <p><span class="monospace">Statement(s) to be executed if no expression is true</span>
</p>
<p><span class="monospace">}</span></p>
<p>There is nothing special about this code. It is just a series of if statements, where each if is a part of the else clause of the previous statement. Statement(s) are executed based on the true condition, if none of the conditions is true, then the else block is executed.</p>

                  <h3>While Loops</h3>
                  <p>While writing a program, you may encounter a situation where you need to perform an action over and over again. In such situations, you would need to write loop statements to reduce the number of lines.</p>
                  <p>JavaScript supports all the necessary loops to ease down the pressure of programming</p>

                  <div>
                    <h4>The while Loop</h4>
                    <p>The most basic loop in JavaScript is the while loop which would be discussed in this chapter. The purpose of a while loop is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. Once the expression becomes false, the loop terminates.</p>

                    <li>The loop initialization where we initialize our counter to a starting value. The initialization statement is executed before the loop begins.</li>
                    <li>The test statement which will test if a given condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code given inside the loop will be executed, otherwise the control will come out of the loop.</li>
                    <li>The iteration statement where you can increase or decrease your counter.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>You can put all the three parts in a single line separated by semicolons.</p>
